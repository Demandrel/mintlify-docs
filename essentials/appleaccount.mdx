This is only if you target to build for iOS. Remember that you will need a Mac to build for iOS, so if you don't have one or want to build only for Android, you can skip this page.

# Create an Apple account for developers&#x20;

Go to [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com/) and create a dev account. It may take 24 hours to be activated and will cost you $99.![](/CleanShot2025-02-17at23.35.45.png)

Then select service ID:![](/CleanShot2025-02-17at23.54.19.png)

This will be used to Sign in with Apple, so enter as a name something like "sign in with Apple" and you can reverse your domain and add "si" for sign in:![](/CleanShot2025-02-17at23.55.39.png)

Validate, and you are good for now.

# Create a private key

Go back to your Apple dev account and create a new key: ![](/CleanShot2025-02-17at23.58.10.png)

Then click on continue to validate your Key. At this step, don't hit download: if you do it you will never be able to download the key again and will need to recreate a new one. So just hit "done" and will download the key later.![](/CleanShot2025-02-18at00.02.30.png)
