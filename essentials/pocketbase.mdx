Supatauri uses Pocketbase, an open source, fast and easy to learn data base. We will see here how to setup your own Pocketbase instance for development and also how to self host it for production.![](/CleanShot2025-02-17at15.31.30.png)

## Why Pocketbase?

We decided to use pocketbase for several reasons:

* Clear documentation.&#x20;

* Easy setup: your data base can just be copy paste, not need to spend hours to configure it.

* Fast: Pocketbase is really fast.&#x20;

* Low price: A self hosted Pocketbase database can handle 10 000 users at the same time, on a $5/month server. The same activity would cost your arround $1000/month with Supabase of Vercel.&#x20;

* Easy to self host: Pocketbase is easy to self host, even if you do this for the first time. We will guide you throw this within this documentation.&#x20;
