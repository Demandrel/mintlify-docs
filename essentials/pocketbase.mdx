## Why Pocketbase?

We decided to use pocketbase for several reasons:

* Clear documentation.&#x20;

* Easy setup: your data base can just be copy paste, not need to spend hours to configure it.

* Fast: Pocketbase is really fast.&#x20;

* Low price: A self hosted Pocketbase database can handle 10 000 users at the same time, on a $5/month server. The same activity would cost your arround $1000/month with Supabase of Vercel.&#x20;

* Easy to self host: Pocketbase is easy to self host, even if you do this for the first time. We will guide you throw this within this documentation.&#x20;
